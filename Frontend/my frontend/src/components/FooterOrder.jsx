      <hr />
      <p>
        Make sure to add one business day to allow for processing when you place
        your order, in addition to the time it takes for the order to get to you
        once it has shipped. This time is usually about 5-10 business days
        within the EU but is often faster. This is different from country to
        country. 95% of our EU shipments arrives within a week after receiving
        your payment. <hr />
        <br />
        International shipments within the EU have usually no problems getting
        through customs. Shipping outside the EU can take a little bit longer
        due to customs but are most of the times processed quickly. <hr />
        <br />
        Note that for the EU there are virtually no import tariffs for loose
        electronic components, parts & PCBs. However, you are responsible for
        any VAT, tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, customs clearance charges,
        etc. etc. This said, untill this day we never had this kind of problem
        shipping items within the EU. Shipping time outside the EU can take a
        little bit longer due to customs. Sometimes you will have to pay VAT or
        any other fees for importing goods. <hr />
